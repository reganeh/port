            <p>Do you have something you loved to do as a younger version of yourself that you’ve slowly let slip away as you’ve grown older and as other responsibilities took over? For me, that was arts, crafts, and my more creative and artistic side.  </p>
            <p>This past semester, I was able to rediscover this version of myself and one of my neglected passions. I had the opportunity of taking an Introductory Graphic Design Course where I learned how to navigate Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop and brought my creative spark back into my life.</p>
            <p>Below are a few of my assignments from the class. While they are extremely simple, creating them taught me many useful skills and more about the power tools Adobe offers. I can’t wait to keep designing more!</p>
